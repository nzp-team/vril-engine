		<h2>Getting the game to run</h2>
		<h3>Everybody!</h3>
		<p>To run Quake on your PSP, you <em>need</em> the data files from either the shareware version of Quake, or the full version.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Get the data files:
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Buy</strong> the full version of Quake <a href="http://www.idsoftware.com/games/quake/quake/index.php?game_section=buy">here</a>, or on eBay; or</li>
					<li><strong>Download</strong> the demo version of Quake for free <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=158726&package_id=177975&release_id=391629">here</a>.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Copy the <strong>ID1</strong> directory from the demo to <strong>Quake/ID1</strong>.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h3>Firmware 3.10 OE-A2 and compatible</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Copy the <strong>Quake</strong> directory to <strong>/PSP/GAME/Quake</strong> on your PSP.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Other firmware version?</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Only custom firmwares are supported at the moment.</li>

		<h3>Q &amp; A</h3>
		<table border="2">
			<tr>
				<th>Question</th>
				<th>Answer</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Where do you get the full version of Quake?</td>
				<td>You buy it. It's quite hard to find nowadays, but you should be able to get it on eBay without too much difficulty. I did.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Where do you get the demo version of Quake?</td>
				<td>You download it. We have made it available <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=158726&package_id=177975&release_id=391629">here</a>.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Why don't you bundle the shareware data files with your release?</td>
				<td>Because the demo's license says not to do that. We have to distribute the <em>complete demo</em>, not just the data files. We did however package it up as .rar and .zip, making it a lot easier to get at the files compared to id's DOS installer.</td>
